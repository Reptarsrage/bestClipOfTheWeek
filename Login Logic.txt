todo:
	php:
		make it return all the errors not just the last one!
	
	login:
		create page
			username
			password
			submit
			errors
			pretty css
		create backend support for login feature
			create table login_cred
				userID
				password
				security token
				security token expiration datetime
		on login authorize
			js send username and password to php
			php generates a security token
			php sends request to sql proc to login user using credentials (return success/failure)
				security token expires in 24hrs / when user logs out manually
			is successfull then return security token to js
			js saves this information
		on query authorize user
			js passes security token recieved from backend on login to php
			php querys sql to validate token
				returns 403 forbidden on failure
			php sends query to sql and returns results
			
		things to think about:
			protect/encrypt a table or column in mysql
			how will we handle expired tokens? (never let user stay logged on for more than 24 hours)
			use ssl when communicating with php
