            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
                So I got incredibly bored at work one day and tried to come up with ideas for a side project. Hit a wall so I decided to watch a couple videos on the YouTubes. When suddenly inspiration struck! I figured it would be both fun and a good programming exercise to come up with a way to tally the results of StoneMountain64's Best Clip of the Week videos.
            </p><p>
                This site is not meant for a wide range of users. Mostly just one, although now that I've made it I  possibly see a little room for growth. My intention was to have a program that took a url and a list of terms and returned a count of votes for each term. After I completed this I thought, 'wouldn't it be cool if I could play with the terms, store them and manipulate them?' Well this whim lead to a backend server and a service running on Openshift. Then I thought, wouldn't it be cool if I had some charts? Luckily I was already using Youtube Data and Analytics, and Google+ API's, so adding Google Charts was not difficult. Then I figured since I have a database that may or may not charge me money for heavy use, I need some security. This drove me to make a login in system. Then I figured might as well go balls out and make a bad-ass login page, so I did.
            </p><p>
                After all that was said and done, I had kind of this clunky cool looking website. There are a couple of things that I haven't gotten to yet. The biggest one is improving the load time of the results. Client-side processing, slow google API's and zero caching have all added up to a whopping 90sec page load time... and unless I want to spend money and/or a ton of time, I'm not sure how to improve this. There is also the issue with errors cropping up. I didn't write unit tests as this was just kind of an ad-hoc fun project and I didn't want to deal with the overhead. There are some pretty heavy restrictions on my back-end server size, the amount of API calls I can make, and a few other limiting factors.
            </p><p>
                I had a super fun time making this site. Flaws and all I think it turned out pretty well.
